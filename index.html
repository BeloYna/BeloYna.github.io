    <p>These laws, also known as <strong>Asimov's Laws</strong> were originally formulated by science-fiction author Isaac Asimov in the 1940s, but they're now referred to in movies <em>and</em> the news.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
        <li>A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, <em>except</em> where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
        <li>A robot must protect its own existence <em>as long as</em> such protection <strong>does not conflict</strong> with the First or Second Law.</li>
    </ul>
